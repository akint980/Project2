      <h3>Business insights of an Online Superstore</h3>
      <p>This project studies the buying behavior of customers in an online Super store for 3 years in the 50 states of United States of America.</p>
      <p>After cleaning my raw data, I produced a chart that showed how the rate at which online sales grew
      <p>From the first year to the third year.A bar chart showed the profit made per sub-category item. Another chart showed  the profit made by state.This gave insights into states that would provide highest</p>
      <p>profit if an online store decides to take orders only from that state.From year 2014 to 2017 we also saw how the profits increased graduaally.</p>                
      <p>The highest profit came from the western region of United States which made me conclude that Online sales thrives more in the Western Part of USA.Also the online sales of Tables incurred the graeatest loss</p>
      <p>The reason might be due to shipping cost or damages during shipping.Although there was no evidence to supprt this but I conclude that more evidence is needed to support this claim.</p>
